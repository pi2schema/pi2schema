# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a new crypto provider that leverages HashiCorp Vault's transit encryption engine to provide GDPR-compliant encryption key management. The provider will use Vault's transit encryption to encrypt/decrypt Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) for each subject, ensuring that personal data encryption keys can be properly managed and deleted to meet GDPR requirements.

The provider will implement both the `EncryptingMaterialsProvider` and `DecryptingMaterialsProvider` interfaces from the crypto-spi module, providing a complete solution for subject-based encryption key management using Vault as the backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the pi2schema library, I want to use HashiCorp Vault's transit encryption for managing encryption keys, so that I can leverage Vault's security features and compliance capabilities for GDPR requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs encryption materials for a subject THEN the provider SHALL generate a new Data Encryption Key (DEK) using Tink's AEAD primitive
2. WHEN a DEK is generated THEN the provider SHALL encrypt the DEK using Vault's transit encryption engine with subject-specific keys
3. WHEN encryption materials are requested THEN the provider SHALL return an EncryptionMaterial object containing the plaintext DEK and encrypted DEK
4. IF Vault is unavailable THEN the provider SHALL throw a meaningful exception indicating the connectivity issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer implementing GDPR compliance, I want the ability to decrypt previously encrypted data using subject-specific keys, so that I can access personal data when legally required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN decryption is requested for a subject THEN the provider SHALL use Vault's transit encryption to decrypt the provided encrypted DEK
2. WHEN decrypting THEN the provider SHALL use the subject ID to locate the appropriate key in Vault for proper key isolation
3. WHEN decryption is successful THEN the provider SHALL return a ready-to-use Tink AEAD primitive
4. IF the encrypted DEK cannot be decrypted THEN the provider SHALL throw a meaningful exception
5. IF the subject ID is invalid THEN the provider SHALL throw a validation exception

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Vault crypto provider to be configurable with different Vault instances and authentication methods, so that I can integrate it with my existing Vault infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the provider THEN it SHALL accept Vault connection configuration including URL, authentication method, and transit engine path
2. WHEN authenticating with Vault THEN the provider SHALL support token-based authentication as the primary method
3. WHEN configured THEN the configuration SHALL be validated during VaultCryptoConfiguration creation with clear error messages
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the provider SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
5. WHEN the provider is closed THEN it SHALL properly clean up Vault connections and resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer concerned with performance, I want the Vault crypto provider to handle concurrent requests efficiently, so that my application can scale without encryption becoming a bottleneck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple encryption requests are made concurrently THEN the provider SHALL handle them using CompletableFuture for asynchronous processing
2. WHEN making Vault API calls THEN the provider SHALL use connection pooling to optimize performance
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the provider SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN under load THEN the provider SHALL not block threads waiting for Vault responses
5. IF Vault responses are slow THEN the provider SHALL respect configured timeout values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging in the Vault crypto provider, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot encryption operations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vault operations fail THEN the provider SHALL log detailed error information without exposing sensitive data
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the provider SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the authentication issue
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the provider SHALL distinguish between temporary and permanent failures
4. WHEN input validation fails THEN the provider SHALL log the validation error with sufficient detail for debugging
5. IF unexpected errors occur THEN the provider SHALL wrap them in appropriate custom exceptions with meaningful messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the Vault crypto provider to support GDPR right-to-be-forgotten requirements, so that personal data can be effectively deleted when requested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a subject requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL be able to identify all encryption keys associated with that subject
2. WHEN keys are managed in Vault THEN the provider SHALL use subject-specific key derivation or storage patterns
3. WHEN implementing key isolation THEN each subject SHALL have cryptographically separate encryption materials
4. IF a subject's keys are deleted from Vault THEN previously encrypted data for that subject SHALL become unrecoverable
5. WHEN key deletion is performed THEN the provider SHALL provide confirmation of successful deletion
